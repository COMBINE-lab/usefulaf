## Useful R functions for preparing and processing data for alevin-fry.

* `build_splici_ref.R` — A script to build a spliced + intron (splici) ref for indexing and quantification with `alevin-fry`. This function is now included in the [`roe`](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/roe). Please follow [this instruction](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/roe#installlation) to install `roe`.

* `cellRangerLikeEmptyDrops.R` — An implementation of the hybrid UMI count filtering and [`emptyDrops`](https://github.com/MarioniLab/DropletUtils) used by CellRanger (and subsequently by [STARsolo](https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR)). This R implementation is a translation of the implementation in STARsolo, which itself was reverse-engineered from CellRanger. *This script should only be used for the old R version ($<$ R v4.1.0 and BioC 3.1.4).* If you have a higher version of R, please use the `emptyDropsCellRanger()` function in the [`DropletUtils`](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DropletUtils.html) BioConductor package. 
* `load_fry.R` — Contains a function to load `alevin-fry` output (including from USA mode quantification) into a [`SingleCellExperiment`](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/SingleCellExperiment.html) object. *This script should only be used for old R version ($<$ R v4.1.0 and BioC 3.1.4).* If you have a higher version of R, please use the `loadFry()` function in the [`fishpond`](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DropletUtils.html) BioConductor package.
